# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise is funding her new play, _Fever_, through a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign with a goal of $10,000. She has access to Kickstarter data for other campaigns and had an analysis completed to determine when she should launch and if her goal is achievable. After launch, she raised close to her goal in a short time frame.
### Purpose
She wants to know the results of other campaigns based on when they launched and their funding goal. She wants to focus the results on theater productions and a subset of that that matches hers - plays.
